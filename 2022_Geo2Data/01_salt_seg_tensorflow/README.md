To run this notebook, we recommend using `conda` with the `conda-forge` channel.

A new `conda` environment can be created by:
```shell
conda create --name <env> --file requirements_conda.txt
```
(replace <env> with your environment name)

If you prefer using `pip`, please use the `requirements_pip.txt`.

However, the `pip` environment is NOT tested, use at your own risk.
