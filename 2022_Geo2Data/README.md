# Description

In this workshop, we look back to some of the more notebooks from the 2019 TGS Salt
Identification Challenge. This challenge took place 3 years ago and was the first of its kind for our discipline. 
You can expect a brief introduction to CNNs, more specifically U-nets, and how they were used to tackle this challenge.
We will be running through some notebooks in real-time to give you more hands-on experience. When registration closes,
we will send out notebooks and additional supporting information to registrants.
